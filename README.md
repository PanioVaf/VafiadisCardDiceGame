# VafiadisCardDiceGame
At the rally organized by JohnBeker, 14 people gathered.
Each person has a name and each name consists of the first name and the
last name.
Some of the guests like to play dice. Every dice player has
the ability to roll a dice and bring a result. However some players
they have a technique to roll the dice and manage to bring 6 instead of 5. Some
others manage to roll 5 instead of 3. The other players normally roll the dice
so they bring from 1-6 with a probability of 1/6 for each possible result.
Also, some of the guests are playing cards.
John's guests include some who play exclusively
dice, some playing only cards but also some playing cards
and dice.
2 players participate in a dice game. They roll alternately from 10 dice. Every time
that the 2 players roll the dice or one brings a bigger result than the other
or bring the same result. In the first case, the cumulative is informed
score of the player who brought the highest score. In the second case no
no score is updated.
All available (card) players participate in a hand of cards. In the beginning
shuffle the deck and then draw from a card alternately
until the cards run out. At the end of the game, each player presents them
aces he has and opens his cards. The winner is the one who has collected
more aces.
